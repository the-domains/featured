Life is a learning process.  No one has the ability to know everything or even know how to do things without a reference point.  Knowledge leads to understanding.  Understanding leads to wisdom.  When one is born, they have nothing.  When they are old, they are filled with experience.  Knowledge and understanding bring one away from the initial innocence of life, but is regained when one is born again into Christ.
